Problem: An ice cream company wants an easy and efficient way to select today's available flavors from a list of all of their flavors.

Solution: A React/JS program which prioritizes yesterday's selected flavors at the top of the available flavors list. This way, someone could easily go through and click all the flavors that stayed the same from yesterday, drastically saving on time entering and searching for flavors.
